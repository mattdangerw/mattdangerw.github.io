# Matthew Watson

Hello! I am software engineer at Google working on the Keras and Tensorflow
teams. I am currently working on developing [KerasNLP](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-nlp),
a new open source library for NLP workflows within Keras ecosystem.

Almost an English major, I'm interested in fuzzy human problems and their
intersection with technology. I am deeply interested in improving our
understanding of language models, their mechanisms of success, and making sure
we develop NLP tools that are aligned with our values.

Outside of work, I'm an avid climber and once spent three months in the woods
hiking on the Pacific Crest Trail.

## Software

- [KerasNLP](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-nlp)

  KerasNLP is a new library for natural language processing workflows within
  the Keras ecosystem. I have been the primary contributor to this library since
  it's inception.

- [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras)

  Keras is deep learning for humans! And the high-level library packaged with
  tensorflow for saving models. I have been a developer and maintainer of the
  Keras library since 2020.

## Talks

## Writings

- [Pretraining a Transformer from scratch with KerasNLP](https://keras.io/guides/keras_nlp/transformer_pretraining/)
  
  A guide on pretraining a transformer with a masked langauge modeling tasks
  that also serves as an introduction to the lower-level building blocks in the
  KerasNLP library.

- [An Introduction to Keras Preprocessing Layers](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2021/11/an-introduction-to-keras-preprocessing.html)
  
  A post on the Tensorflow blog detailing the uses of Keras Preprocessing
  Layers.

## Publications

- [Synthesizing Open Worlds with Constraints using Locally Annealed Reversible Jump MCMC](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~lfyg/owl.pdf)
  A while ago I worked at the Stanford Graphics Labs. This paper leverages
  lays out a system where users could enter a system of constrains, and randomly
  sample layouts that met these constraints. I helped apply to concept to
  procedural level generation in video games.
